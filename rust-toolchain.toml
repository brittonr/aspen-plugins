[toolchain]
# Nightly channel for access to unstable features and latest performance improvements.
#
# Key features enabled by nightly:
# - Native async fn in traits (migrating from async-trait proc-macro)
# - impl_trait_in_assoc_type for reduced boxing in RPC handlers
# - const trait methods for verified pure functions
# - Improved compile times via new trait solver and lld linker
#
# Note: hyperlight-wasm features (plugins-vm, plugins-wasm) are temporarily
# disabled due to cargo-hyperlight v0.1.5 requiring --build-plan (removed in
# Cargo 1.93). Re-enable when cargo-hyperlight is updated.
# Tracking: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5579
